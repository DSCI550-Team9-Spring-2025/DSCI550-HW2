When he discovered her pregnancy, he threw her down the stairs (which no longer exist, although remnants can be seen in an upstairs closet) running from the attic to the kitchen. Alicia still haunts the house to this day. Noises have been heard throughout the house, the attic light, where Alicia lived,?ámysteriously goes on and off. The attic is just storage currently. Bedroom lights go on and off unexpectedly. Pictures of men are often turned around or covered. One sister had a male friend visit overnight. During the night, she was awoken by the bed shaking only to see him fast asleep. She also felt cold air in her ear and no one was there nor any window. Possibly unrelated to Alicia, one fish tank would leak in every room except when placed in the middle living room. A few years ago, several boys tried to spend the night in the attic at 2am they ran out screaming and never explained what terrified them. They refused to return to the house."

If you are on stage you fell like you are being watched from the audience when no one else is in the room. There have been sightings of ghostly images of a man in the Auditorium's light/sound room. He is normally seen staring at stage watching what people are doing. Also if you are on stage, look up, and to the right, you can see the name ""Fred"" spray painted far away from the cat walk where no one can reach. - March 2008 Update: Its been said that a man hung himself in the projection booth in the Auditorium. A few people have reported seeing a image of a man in the projection booth and when someone goes to investigate, no one is there. Also it does not say the name Fred anymore, either someone has painted over it or it just disappeared."

ghost	Coloma	38.7999214	United States	691.1315789	26.67368421	38.64736842	160.6684211	21.56842105	185.4684211	19.93684211	7.821052632	9.889473684	29.71578947	"In Coloma, CA, there is a famous Victorian house called the Vineyard House, which has been reputed to be haunted by its original owners for many years. The house was built some time in the late 1800s, and was used over the years as a jail, an inn and restaurant, and, as its name implies, a winery. It was also at one time supposedly the site of where some executions took place. According to records, the original owners who built the house suffered one tragedy after another. Several of their young children died, their winery was eventually ruined because of a blight, and the husband contracted syphilis, which over time caused blindness and mental illness. Because he became violent from being mentally ill, his wife had him chained to a wall in the basement of the house, where he reportedly died. The entire family is buried directly across the street in a graveyard that overlooks the house. Reports of seeing ghosts in the graveyard have also come forth in the past, but most of the stories took place inside the house. Ghost stories of the encounters where told by employees and guests of Vineyard House. One intriguing story was told by a couple who were staying in one of the upstairs bedrooms. It was late at night and all was quiet, when suddenly the couple was awakened by the sound of drunken men coming into the hallway downstairs. They were very loud and were singing and laughing and making a general raucous, so the husband upstairs stuck his head out the bedroom door to tell the loud men to quiet down. But upon doing so, he saw three men dressed in Victorian clothing ascending the stairs, and then they faded right before his eyes. Another story from a different couple who decided to stay at the inn was that something frightened them so badly that they packed up and left in the middle of the night. They reportedly refused to say what had happened that scared them so badly. The basement was used as a bar, and it was late at night after closing hours. The owner was cleaning up and wiping down he bar. He said that there was one last glass at the far end of the bar, and as he was cleaning, the glass suddenly began to shake, and then it slid all the way across until it finally stopped right in front of him. He admitted that he had no rational explanation for what he'd seen. It is believed that the things that go on in the bar are the original owner who died down there while chained to a wall. Other things that have been reported are sounds of rustling skirts, and there is apparently an area near the kitchen that is constantly cold. A woman having dinner in the restaurant claimed that she was approached by a young child who asked her to mash his peas and carrots for him. Another scary incident occurred in the restaurant when a large chandelier suddenly came crashing down, barely missing some of the guests. It used to be that when the restaurant and inn were still in operation, you could pick up a pamphlet that gave information about the hauntings. It was a famous place because it had been there since the Gold Rush, and there were pictures of famous people, such as John Wayne and Dudley Moore, hanging on the walls. The hauntings were so well-known that the house was featured on That's Incredible! and Ripley's Believe It Or Not. Sadly, the house has been closed to the public for quite a few years. If you are ever visiting old Coloma, the site of the famous Gold Rush, be sure to drive by the old Vineyard House, and know that you are seeing a house that has been famous for its hauntings for many years."

When investigated, no one could have said this. One person, when late on the bus, heard behind him someone call his name. He looked behind him and saw that no one behind him was calling his name. Earlier that day, he saw someone from behind outside disappear. A person saw someone going into the bathroom mentioned above, but right when the person got out, the someone was outside. There was no chance of backtracking or using the back door (it was locked). On a dark January day in 2005, a person went into the same bathroom and saw a blob-like shadow went across the floor. The person did not look up and washed his hands and got out of there. The only window was too far away and was at a poor angle for it to have come from the outside and it was dark and overcast at the time, besides it happening roughly 1:00 pm."

Now door slam shut and thing are moved. One teacher was there late at night alone cutting paper in the workroom. When he heard someone in the hall, he looked out and no one was there, again he heard it he checks the whole school and no one was there. When he came back to the workroom all his trash was gone. When teachers would work late, small children could be heard, but not seen and an old man is heard roaming the halls. Teachers were heard teaching. And in a non-personal account (heard from teacher who was there): She was designing the bulletin board when she heard ghostly footsteps in the hall. Her daughter and her were alone in the building. Her daughter chased them and when this teacher looked out in the hall, her girl was walking with her arm in the air as if grasping an adults'. But there was no one. She called her daughter back and the girl explained, she was just walking with the nice old man. Possibly the janitor. One teacher had some students there to help with a project one night. When it was time to leave, he sent the students left and right into the building to make sure no one was still inside. The students met after completing the search and began to leave when they heard running footsteps and voices coming down the stairs. Update: the haunted portion of the school is no longer open to students or teachers."

This descendant of Valentine Hill is believed to be the home's most restless spirit. Over the years we have found Hannah to be quite fond of electronics and to enjoy playing hide and seek with a variety of inordinate objects. It is believed that Hannah does not like change and makes this very well known when new equipment with a power cord is brought on to the property. This often times has forced the Inn to seek outside assistance with help for something as simple today as a new computer or copy machine which has stumped our vendors as to why certain items will not properly work. The numbers have appeared backwards on a calculators ten key. While printing one page from a computer several pages have began printing even after the computer and printer were turned off and unplugged leaving the printer without power continuing to print for nearly twenty minutes until the paper was gone.?á Hannah has a special affection towards some of the Inns employees. The Inn is staffed 24 hours a day therefore the Inn has an employee stay overnight. On one occasion, an employee was sleeping to be awoken by someone playing with her hair. Aware that Hannah is often around, she simply tucked her hair into her nightgown and told Hannah to go to bed. On another occasion another employee was fast asleep, again, awoken by the sound of someone walking around our front parlor. Quickly the employee went downstairs and found every drawer in the armoire, desk and filing cabinet pulled out by exactly one inch. On occasion Hanna has shown herself. One evening a former Chef was working in the food and beverage office late into the evening. Shortly after 1:00am the Chef locked the office and was making way up the stairs from the Tavern to leave when a movement happened. Below the staircase is a railing that looks behind the bar. In looking down to see what the movement was the Chef was shocked to see Hannah standing behind the bar area looking up at the Chef. Often times locks with deadbolts have a way of locking themselves while no one is near. While a party from a local insurance company were dining in our Maples dining room during the holiday season the entire party witnessed a glass from a table across the room where not a sole was near, pick itself up off the table and smash against the side of the table to land in pieces?áon the floor.?á Much of the Staff and Guests alike have witnessed the shadow, face, touch or vintage clothing of this magnificent woman named Hannah. Given the history of the Inn it is believed that several spirits other than Hannah reside in this home today. Guest have made mention of footsteps and moving furniture above their heads during the night while there were not any guest above them to have made any sounds."

Also, multiple ghosts have been reported by managers past in the upstairs theaters that used to be one large balcony. Voices have been heard in the hall near auditorium #5 late at night when no one was in the building. An usher once heard someone call his name in auditorium #3 late at night when no one was around. And, last, an assistant manager once told me she had been followed up the hall by a shadow figure on the wall that was not hers."

She has been said to be the cause of calls to the Lino police in places where there are no phones (such as the religious classrooms).?á The people who work in the office have experienced doors opening and slamming shut, and the piano player has witnessed the keyboard being played & no one was sitting on the bench. Another witness said that she was sitting at her desk and a bible fell off the shelf. After putting it back up, a few minutes later it fell back down. This when on for a while. One of the teens in the church has said to have heard heels walking behind her and there was no one there. Then she heard someone whisper ""Stop That!"" No one was there."
